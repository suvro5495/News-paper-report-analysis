English News Paper Report Analysis by leveraging several NLP techniques


News Classification and Analysis using NLP Techniques:-

A. Real-time Situation:
In today's rapidly evolving digital media landscape, understanding and categorizing news articles is essential. I addressed this challenge by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles into predefined topics and extract insightful information from their textual content.

B. Key Components: Data Collection and Preprocessing

      i. Lowercasing- Standardized text to lowercase for consistency.
      ii. URL Removal- Eliminated URLs to reduce noise.
      iii. HTML Tags Removal- Stripped HTML tags for cleaner text.
      iv. Abbreviation Replacement- Enhanced readability by replacing abbreviations.
      v. Emoji Removal- Removed emojis to focus solely on text analysis.
      vi. Tokenization- Broke down text into meaningful units for analysis.
      vii. Stopword Removal- Eliminated common stopwords to focus on significant content.
      viii. Punctuation Removal- Removed unnecessary punctuation marks for clarity.

      
C. Topic Classification:
Developed NLP classification models using Bag-of-Words (BoW) technique combined with multinomial models. Explored logistic regression, random forests, CNNs, and transformers (BERT) for classification.

D. Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained models on labeled datasets, fine-tuning for accuracy improvement. Evaluated performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

E. Topic Analysis and Insights:
Unveiled trends, popular topics, and patterns in news coverage, offering a profound understanding of public discourse evolution.

F. Visualization and Reporting:
Crafted visually engaging representations such as topic distribution plots and word clouds to present findings effectively.

       (i) Preprocessed Dataset:
       a. The dataset contains 199,706 English news articles with headlines, content, news categories, and dates.
       b. Data preprocessing steps included lowercasing, removing HTML tags, emojis, URLs, punctuation, stopwords, and expanding abbreviations.
       c. News categories were grouped, with rare categories combined into an 'Other' category.
       d. The dataset was tokenized and split into training and test sets.
       
       (ii) Trained Classification Models:
       a. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with Bag of Words (BoW) features achieved an accuracy of 0.89 on the test set.
       b. Cross-validation with 3 folds gave a mean accuracy of 0.88.
       c. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV improved the accuracy to 0.893 with the best parameters: max_features=10000, ngram_range=(1,1), alpha=0.405.
       
       (iii) Evaluation Results:
       a. The best model correctly predicted 35,671 samples and misclassified 4,271 samples from the test set.
       b. A final dataframe was created with the content, predicted labels, and actual labels for analysis.
       
       (iv) Insights:
       a. The most prevalent news categories were 'politics', 'education', 'miscellaneous', 'sports', 'business', 'entertainment', and 'technology'.
       b. The distribution of news articles across categories provides insights into the focus areas of news coverage.
       
       (v) Recommendations:
       a. Explore other feature representations like TF-IDF or word embeddings, which may capture semantics better and improve classification accuracy.
       b. Investigate alternative machine learning models, such as ensemble methods or deep learning approaches, for potentially better performance.
       c. Analyze misclassified samples to identify patterns and areas for improvement in the classification model.
       d. Incorporate additional features like publication source, author, or metadata to enhance the classification process.
       e. Develop a system to monitor and track changes in news categories and topics over time, providing insights into evolving public discourse.

In summary, the analysis provides a foundation for news classification and insights into news coverage trends. Further improvements and applications can be explored to enhance the accuracy and understanding of public discourse through news analysis.

G. Outcomes:
Produced NLP models with high accuracy in news categorization. Offered insights into topic distribution and emerging trends, along with recommendations for enhancing accuracy.

H. Deliverables:
Included preprocessed dataset with labeled categories, trained classification models, and a comprehensive report summarizing insights.

I. Conclusion:
This project harnesses NLP techniques for news classification and analysis, offering valuable insights into topic distribution and trends. By automating classification and extracting actionable insights, it contributes to better understanding in the dynamic news landscape.
